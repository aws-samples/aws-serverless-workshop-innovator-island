In this module you:

- Connected your backend application with the Flow & Traffic Controller's SNS topic.
- Created a Lambda function that was invoked by the SNS topic whenever a new message is published.
- Published the message to the IoT topic for the front end.
- Updated the frontend with the configuration information so it can listen to new messages on the IoT topic.

Once you have seen the new functionality in the published application URL, proceed to the next module, where you will add ride photo processing.
