To complete this workshop, you will need an AWS account and access to create AWS resources within that account.

If you are doing this workshop as part of an AWS event, an account will be provided, you will not need to use an existing account or create a new one.

If you do need to use your own account, use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than using an organization's account to ensure you have full access to the necessary services and you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using an AWS account at a time. If you attempt to share an account with another participant, you will encounter naming conflicts for certain resources.
